# HardNet model implementation

HardNet model implementation in PyTorch for NIPS 2017 paper ["Working hard to know your neighbor's margins: Local descriptor learning loss"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10872)

## Requirements

Please use Python 2.7, install OpenCV and additional libraries from requirements.txt

## Datasets and Training

To download datasets and start learning descriptor:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DagnyT/hardnet
./run_me.sh
```

Logs are stored in tensorboard format in directory logs/

## Pre-trained models

Pre-trained models can be found in folder pretrained:  train_liberty and train_liberty_with_aug

## Usage example

We provide an example, how to describe patches with HardNet. Script expects patches in [HPatches](https://github.com/hpatches/hpatches-benchmark) format, i.e. grayscale image with w = patch_size and h = n_patches * patch_size
```
cd examples
python extract_hardnet_desc_from_hpatches_file.py imgs/ref.png out.txt
```
or with Caffe:
```    
cd examples/caffe
python extract_hardnetCaffe_desc_from_hpatches_file.py ../imgs/ref.png hardnet_caffe.txt
```
